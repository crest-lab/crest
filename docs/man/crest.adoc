== OPTIONS

The FIRST argument CAN be a coordinate file in the TM **(coord, Bohr)** or Xmol **(*.xyz, Ang.)** format.
If no such file is present as the first argument **crest** will automatically search for a file called "`**coord**`" in the TM format.

  (_OUTDATED_)

*-v2*::
  Use the MTD-GC workflow.
  (_OUTDATED_)

  Parallel settings are then determined automatically for each step.
  If not set by "`**-T**`", this number is read from the **OMP_NUM_THREADS** global variable.
